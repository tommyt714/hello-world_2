Getting back into Github

Hello everyone,

This is me (Tommy Thompson) dusting off my old, very beginner's Github in order to better learn how to appropriately use Github, especially as a personal and professional project portfolio.

Go easy on me!


8/30/19 - For real this time, I'm going to get into the habit of using Github regularly to keep track of my random coding projects!  Let's hope it works out!
